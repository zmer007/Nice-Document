**Describe a sport you are good at: Tennis**

I would like to talk about tennis, which is my best love among all the popular sports. Tennis is popular all over the world, especially loved by teenagers. There is a comic book named, Prince of Tennis, illustrated by a Japanese artist. The spread of this book made tennis more popular.

The spirit of tennis is practice makes perfect, and we should never give up. When I was in sixth grade, I began to learn how to play tennis because I was a fan of the comic book. When I play tennis, I will devote myself to it. I have entered for many tennis competitions. I like winning so the procedure seems exciting. At that time, I was not good at sports. But after playing tennis, my PE grades becamce the best in my class.

Because of tennis, I learned that I should never give up when I face difficulties. I still have lots more to work on. Tennis is my favorite outdoor sport.
